\title{Run Sequoia pedigree/parentage assignment with snpR}
\usage{
run_sequoia(
  x,
  facets = NULL,
  run_dupcheck = FALSE,
  run_parents = FALSE,
  run_pedigree = FALSE,
  pMaxSibIter = 10,
  min_maf = 0.3,
  min_ind = 0.5,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{snpRdata object.}

\item{facets}{character, default NULL. Sample-specific facets over which the
sequoia is called to run. See \code{\link{Facets_in_snpR}}.}

\item{run_dupcheck}{FALSE or TRUE, default FALSE. Determines if a Sequoia
function used to check for duplicate samples in the dataset should be run
prior to further analysis. This is generally recommended.}

\item{run_parents}{FALSE or TRUE, default FALSE. Determines if a Sequoia
function to assign parents should be run. This runs quickly and is required
before running the run_pedigree command.}

\item{run_pedigree}{FALSE or TRUE, default FALSE. Determines if a Sequoia
function to construct full pedigree for the sample set should be run. This
can take a while, since sibship clustering takes a lot of time for larger
datasets.}

\item{pMaxSibIter}{numeric in 1:25, default 10. Maximum iterations to run for
sibship clustering. Only specified for run_pedigree argument.}

\item{min_maf}{numeric in 0.25:0.5, default 0.3. Minimum allele frequency
cutoff for analysis. Sequoia requires high minor allele frequencies for
parentage and pedigree construction, so it is not generally recommended to
reduce this number.}

\item{min_ind}{numeric in 0.5:1, default 0.5. Removes loci sequenced in less
than this proportion of individuals. Note that \emph{individuals} with
genotypes for less than half of the loci will be automatically removed by
sequoia.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to \code{\link[sequoia]{sequoia}}
(during parentage and pedigree reconstruction).}
}
\value{
A data.frame for each facet specified with sequoia output summary
  information.
}
\description{
Runs the \code{\link[sequoia]{sequoia}} parentage assignment and pedigree
construction tool. Note that this function \emph{is not overwrite safe!}.
}
\details{
This is an integration of the program and package written by Jisca Huisman.
Note that there are many more Sequoia specific arguments that can be added to
change from the default settings (eg. ErrorM, Tassign, Tfilt, GetMaybeRel,
etc.) See documentation for \code{\link[sequoia]{sequoia}}. These can be
passed to the pedigree and parentage reconstructions using the ... argument
to run_sequoia.

\examples{
# to follow an example using the stickSNPs example dataset you need to add some variables that don't exist in the actual dataset.
a <- 2013:2015 #create a vector of possible birthyears
b <- c("M", "F", "U") #create a vector of possible sexes
stk <- stickSNPs
sample.meta(stk)$BirthYear <- sample(x = a, size = nsamps(stickSNPs), replace = TRUE) #create birth years
sample.meta(stk)$ID <- 1:nsamps(stk) #create unique sampleID
sample.meta(stk)$Sex <- sample(x= b, size = nsamps(stk), replace = TRUE) # create sexes
dup <- run_sequoia(x = stk, run_dupcheck = TRUE, run_parents = FALSE, run_pedigree = FALSE)
