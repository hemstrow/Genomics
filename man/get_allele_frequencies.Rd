\title{Fetch the allele frequencies for all SNPs for each level of each requested facet.}
\usage{
get_allele_frequencies(x, facets = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{snpRdata object}

\item{facets}{character, default NULL. The facets for which to calculate allele frequencies.
See \code{\link{facets_in_snpR}} for details.}
}
\value{
A named, nested list containing allele frequency matrices for each facet level for all requested facets.
}
\description{
Fetch allele frequencies for all SNPs for each level of all the requested facets.
Major and minor allele frequencies will be interleved, with the major allele first
for each locus. Note that this particular function is not overwrite-safe.
