\title{Caculate p-values from bootstrapped distributions.}
\usage{
calc_p_from_bootstraps(x, facets = "all", statistics = "all",
  alt = "two-sided", par = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{snpRdata object.}

\item{facets}{character, default "all". Facets to use.}

\item{alt}{character, default "two-sided". Specifies the alternative
hypothesis to be used. Options: \itemize{ \item "less": probability that a
bootstrapped value is as small or smaller than observed. \item "greater":
probability that a bootstrapped value is as large or larger than observed.
\item "two-sided": probability that a bootstrapped value is as or more
extreme than observed. }}

\item{par}{numeric or FALSE, default FALSE. If numeric, the number of cores to
use for parallel processing.}
}
\value{
snpRdata object, with p-values merged into the stats or pairwise.stats
 sockets.
}
\description{
\code{calc_p_from_bootstraps} finds p-values for observed \emph{smoothed
window} statistics from bootstrapped distributions, such as produced by
\code{\link{do_bootstraps}}.
}
\details{
Calculates p-values for smoothed values of a statistic based upon a
bootstrapped null distribution of that statistic using an emperical continuous
distribution function.

p-values can be generated for specific snp or sample metadata categories
susing the facets argument, as described in \code{\link{Facets_in_snpR}}. Only
facets for which bootstrap data and raws statistical data have both been
calculated will be run. "all" and NULL follow the typical facet rules.

Likewise, p-values can be generated for specific statistics using the
statistics argument. Only statistics for which bootstrap data and raws
statistical data have both been calculated will be run. By default, all stats
for which a bootstrap null distribution has been generated will be run.
}
\examples{
# add statistics and generate bootstraps
dat <- calc_basic_snp_stats(dat3, c("group.pop"), sigma = 200, step = 150)
dat <- do_bootstraps(dat, facets = c("group.pop"), boots = 1000, sigma = 200, step = 150)
calc_p_from_bootstraps(dat)
