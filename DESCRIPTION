Description: This package contains functions for analyzing SNP whole-genome data in a user-friendly way,
    allowing for the data to be automatically split and calculated across multiple metadata categories simultaneously.
    This includes functions to get most summary statistics and gaussian smooth them, map pairwise LD, 
    determine the significance of smoothed statistics via bootstrapping, do association testing, plot many
    kinds of results, convert to many common output formats, 
    and filter raw SNP genotypes.
