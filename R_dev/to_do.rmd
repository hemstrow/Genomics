# Before 1.0 release:

#### Make a function to make nice plots of smoothed statistics

# New features and upgrades:

#### Make a function to do manhattan plots. Keming is working on this.

#### Make a function to calculate an SFS. Avani is working on this.

* Should do either a raw frequency bin or do projection.

#### Integrate new LD calculation methods.

* Integrate Keming's haplotype likelihood function into the LD calculations as an option.

* Integrate CLD into LD calculations. As an option, run ONLY these, since they are a lot faster (just a single cor() call!).

#### Make a function to do nj trees
* Relatedness matricies is a part of this. Maybe use RAFM.
