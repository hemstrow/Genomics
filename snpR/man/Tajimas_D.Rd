\title{Tajima's D from SNP data.}
\usage{
Tajimas_D(x, ws, step, report = 20)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Input data, in allele count format as given by format_snps output option 1.}

\item{ws}{The size of each window, in kb.}

\item{step}{Lenght to slide between each window, in kb.}

\item{report}{When reporting progress, how many windows should be calculated between each report?}
}
\value{
Data frame containing metadata, Waterson's Theta, Tajima's Theta, and Tajima's D for each window.
}
\description{
Calculates Tajima's theta/pi, Waterson's theta, and Tajima's D over a sliding window. Pi calculated as in Hohenlohe et al. 2010. Tajima's D is calculated using the formula from Tajima (1989) Statistical Method for Testing the Neutral Mutation Hypothesis by DNA Polymorphism.
}
\details{
Description of x:
   Must contain colums containing the number of *unique* alleles, total count of alleles sequenced in all individuals, and subsequent alleles counts for each observed allele in columns named "n_alleles", "n_total", "ni1", and "ni2". Also needs a column containing the position of each SNP, in bp. This matches the allele count/bayescan format as given by format_snps option one.
}
\examples{
#convert example data into the correct format and run splitting by groups and pops.
pops <- table(substr(colnames(stickSNPs[,4:ncol(stickSNPs)]), 1, 3))
l <- list(c(names(pops)), as.numeric(pops))
ac <- format_snps(stickSNPs, 3, pop = l)
run_gp(ac, Tajimas_D, 200, 50)
